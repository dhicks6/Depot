On page 78 I ran into an issue where rails generate scaffold didn't create a products.scss file in depot/app/assets/stylesheets.
I did some googling and found that the newest version of rails no longer creates this file for you.
So I manually created the file products.scss.
After that I went to the books source code page, downloaded the products.scss file and coppied the code into my products.scss file
	leaving the code generated by rails generate scaffold in an html comment block at the top in case I needed it later.
Then I was getting an error which I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was saying can not load file of type sassc.
I then went to my gem file and noticed that gem "sassc-rails" was commented out.
I uncommented it and tried to run rails server again.
I got this message in the command prompt:
C:\Users\dusti\OneDrive\Desktop\WebAppDevFall2022\BookWork\depot>rails server
Could not find gem 'sassc-rails' in locally installed gems.
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.

So I ran bundle install.
Now when I run rails server, on the webpage localhost:3000/products I am getting the error:
NoMethodError in Products#index

*****FIX*****
From line 32:
    <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
I deleted _pack and just left javascript_tag
So the new line 32 is:
    <%= javascript_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
and the webpage localhost:3000/products comes up.
*****TEST*****
To test if this fix and the fix above where I created the products.scss file worked I messed with the padding for one of
	the elements and when I saved the element moved.
